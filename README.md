- Sucharita: Data Gathering (Yahoo Finance & MarketBeat)
- Sachin: DBA (Create ERD and Mock up DB on PGAdmin)
- Yicong: Mock up Machine Learning

### Data Gathering (Yahoo Finance & MarketBeat)
- Used notebook **Scrape_ESG.ipynb** to collect data  about 112 companies in  S&P 500 wiki and Forbes just 100 and used marketbeat.com to scrape the ESG related data and saved the data in Stocks_with_ESG.csv

- Used notebook **Extract_stocks_time_data.ipynb**  using yfinance python wrapper to get the following data from yahoo fianance
    - to collect stock performance of 112 companies since last five years and saved as Stocks_with_time.csv
    - to Collect company info like name , state, city , sector, marketcap, 52 week high etc. and saved as Stocks_info.csv

- Used notebook **final_tables_after_EDA.ipynb** to perform preliminary EDA and ensure that 
    - all three tables have the data about the same 112 companies and companies with no data is deleted. 
    - the no of fields is reduced to exclude unwanted fields.
    - the fields in the dataframe have the correct object type.
    - the Stocks_with_ESG.csv is converted into ESG_df and broken into society_ESG.csv, health_ESG.csv, knowledge_ESG.csv, environment_ESG.csv, net_impact_ESG.csv for further analysis and loading to postgres.

All the csv files can be found in **Resources/Postgres_Input**.

- Based on the csv files an ERD diagram has been created which can be viewed here **ERD_TABLES** 

## Mockup Database
- An ASW RDS database is created with all the tables as shown in the ERD. The tables can be found in **AWS RDS DATBASE.png**
- Used notebook **Connect_Database.ipynb**
    - to connect to aws server
    - select and print data from table

## Mockup Machine learning
- Before predicting the stocks using complex neural network models a linear regression model is used as a mockup,  which can be found in **Stock_Price_valuation.ipynb**
